# testservlet.java
The javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http packages contain interfaces and classes for creating servlets. All servlets should implement the Servlet interface, which defines life-cycle methods. To implement a generic service, we can use the GenericServlet class by extending it. It provides doGet and doPost methods to handle HTTP-specific services.
